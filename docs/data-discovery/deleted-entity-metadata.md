# Deleted Entity Metadata

Entities have a lot of user-generated metadata, such as descriptions, tags, ownership, tiering. There’s also rich metadata generated by OpenMetadata through the data profiler, usage data, lineage, test results, and other graph relationships with other entities. When an entity is deleted, all of this rich information is lost, and it’s not easy to recreate it. OpenMetadata supports soft deletion in the UI and soft and permanent deletion in the API, enabling you to choose whether to maintain metadata for deleted entities.
