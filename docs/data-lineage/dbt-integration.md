# DBT Integration

A DBT model provides transformation logic that creates a table from raw data. While lineage tells us broadly what data a table was generated from. A DBT model provides specifics. OpenMetadata includes an integration for DBT that enables you to see what models are being used to generate tables.

For DBT configuration, please see the connector documentation for the data service from which you want to ingest metadata. DBT configuration instructions are included in the procedures for setting up metadata ingestion for each data service on which we support DBT.
