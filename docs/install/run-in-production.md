# Run in Production

Please refer to the previous section [Run Openmetadata](run-openmetadata.md) for configuring OpenMetadata.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Prerequisites**

* MySQL >= 8.x
* ElasticSearch >= 7.x
* Airflow or other schedulers to run Ingestion Connectors
{% endhint %}

## Start OpenMetadata

OpenMetadata release ships with `./bin/openmetadata` init.d style script.

```
cd openmetdata-0.5.0
./bin/openmetdata start
```

We recommend configuring serviced to monitor the OpenMetadata command to restart in case of any failures.

## Running with a load balancer

One or more OpenMetadata instances can be put behind a load balancer for reverse proxying, in that case, an appropriate OpenMetdata URL must be mentioned in the load balancer's configuration file.

For example, in case Apache mod proxy the VirtualHost tag in the configuration file should be edited out with the following

```
  <VirtualHost *:80>
  <Proxy balancer://mycluster>
      BalancerMember http://127.0.0.1:8585 <!-- First OpenMetadata server -->
      BalancerMember http://127.0.0.2:8686 <!-- Second OpenMetadata server -->
  </Proxy>

      ProxyPreserveHost On

      ProxyPass / balancer://mycluster/
      ProxyPassReverse / balancer://mycluster/
  </VirtualHost>
```
