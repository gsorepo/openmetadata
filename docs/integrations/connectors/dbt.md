# DBT

For DBT configuration, please see the documentation for the relevant connector. DBT configuration instructions are included in the procedures for setting up metadata ingestion for each data service on which we support DBT.

For example, you'll find documentation on configuring DBT for BigQuery [here](https://docs.open-metadata.org/integrations/connectors/bigquery/bigquery-metadata-extraction#7.-configure-dbt-optional).
