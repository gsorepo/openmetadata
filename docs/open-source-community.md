### Meet & Greet on Slack

Thatâ€™s where the OpenMetadata enthusiasts are;\
apart from [GitHub](https://github.com/open-metadata/OpenMetadata), of course.

Catch up with all the discussions and queries on the growing world of metadata. Know what other users are looking for and how OpenMetadata contributes to make their lives easier.

Learn, engage, and get going with your organizationâ€™s needs!

### Bi-Weekly Meetups

Join us on **alternate Wednesdays** over Zoom to learn about OpenMetadataâ€™s progress. We are on a monthly release schedule. So every alternate meeting, we have a new release to showcase.

Come, join in, and share your feedback and questions.
