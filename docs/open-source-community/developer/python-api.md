  We are now going to present a high-level Python API as a type-safe and gentle
  wrapper for the OpenMetadata backend.

# Python API

In the [Solution Design](solution-design.md), we have been dissecting the internals of OpenMetadata. The main conclusion here is twofold:

* **Everything** is handled via the API, and
* **Data structures** (Entity definitions) are at the heart of the solution.

This means that whenever we need to interact with the metadata system or develop a new connector or logic, we have to make sure that we pass the proper inputs and handle the types of outputs.

## Introducing the Python API

Let's suppose that we have our local OpenMetadata server running at `http:localhost:8585`. We can play with it with simple `cURL` or `httpie` commands, and if we just want to take a look at the Entity instances we have lying around, that might probably be enough.

However, let's imagine that we want to create or update an ML Model Entity with a `PUT`. To do so, we need to make sure that we are providing a proper JSON, covering all the attributes and types required by the Entity definition.

By reviewing the [JSON Schema](https://github.com/open-metadata/OpenMetadata/blob/main/catalog-rest-service/src/main/resources/json/schema/api/data/createMlModel.json) for the create operation and the [fields definitions](https://github.com/open-metadata/OpenMetadata/blob/main/catalog-rest-service/src/main/resources/json/schema/entity/data/mlmodel.json) of the Entity, we could come up with a rather simple description of a toy ML Model:

```json
{
    "name": "my-model",
    "description": "sample ML Model",
    "algorithm": "regression",
    "mlFeatures": [
        {
            "name": "age",
            "dataType": "numerical",
            "featureSources": [
                {
                    "name": "age",
                    "dataType": "integer"
                }
            ]
        },
        {
            "name": "persona",
            "dataType": "categorical",
            "featureSources": [
                {
                    "name": "age",
                    "dataType": "integer"
                },
                {
                    "name": "education",
                    "dataType": "string"
                }
            ],
            "featureAlgorithm": "PCA"
        }
    ],
    "mlHyperParameters": [
        {
            "name": "regularisation",
            "value": "0.5"
        }
    ]
}
```

If we needed to repeat this process with a full-fledged model that is built ad-hoc and updated during the CICD process, we would just be adding a hardly maintainable, error-prone requirement to our production deployment pipelines.

The same would happen if, inside the actual OpenMetadata code, there was not a way to easily interact with the API and make sure that we send proper data and can safely process the outputs.

## Using Generated Sources

As OpenMetadata is a data-centric solution, we need to make sure we have the right ingredients at all times. That is why we have developed a high-level Python API, using `pydantic` models automatically generated from the JSON Schemas.

> OBS: If you are using a [published](https://pypi.org/project/openmetadata-ingestion/) version of the Ingestion Framework, you are already good to go, as we package the code with the `metadata.generated` module. If you are developing a new feature, you can get more information [here](build-a-connector/setup.md).

This API wrapper helps developers and consumers in:

* Validating data during development and with specific error messages at runtime,
* Receiving typed responses to ease further processing.

Thanks to the recursive model setting of `pydantic` the example above can be rewritten using only Python classes, and thus being able to get help from IDEs and the Python interpreter. We can rewrite the previous JSON as:

```python
from metadata.generated.schema.api.data.createMlModel import CreateMlModelEntityRequest

from metadata.generated.schema.entity.data.mlmodel import (
    FeatureSource,
    FeatureSourceDataType,
    FeatureType,
    MlFeature,
    MlHyperParameter,
    MlModel,
)

model = CreateMlModelEntityRequest(
    name="test-model-properties",
    algorithm="algo",
    mlFeatures=[
        MlFeature(
            name="age",
            dataType=FeatureType.numerical,
            featureSources=[
                FeatureSource(
                    name="age",
                    dataType=FeatureSourceDataType.integer,
                )
            ],
        ),
        MlFeature(
            name="persona",
            dataType=FeatureType.categorical,
            featureSources=[
                FeatureSource(
                    name="age",
                    dataType=FeatureSourceDataType.integer,
                ),
                FeatureSource(
                    name="education",
                    dataType=FeatureSourceDataType.string,
                ),
            ],
            featureAlgorithm="PCA",
        ),
    ],
    mlHyperParameters=[
        MlHyperParameter(name="regularisation", value="0.5"),
    ],
)
```

## One syntax to rule them all

Now that we know how to directly use the `pydantic` models, we can start showcasing the solution. This module has been built with two main principles in mind:

* **Reusability**: We should be able to support existing and new entities with minimum effort,
* **Extensibility**: However, we are aware that not all Entities are the same. Some of them may require specific functionalities or slight variations (such as `Lineage` or `Location`), so it should be easy to identify those special methods and create new ones when needed.

To this end, we have the main class `OpenMetadata` ([source](https://github.com/open-metadata/OpenMetadata/blob/main/ingestion/src/metadata/ingestion/ometa/ometa\_api.py)) based on Python's `TypeVar`. Thanks to this we can exploit the complete power of the `pydantic` models, having methods with Type Parameters that know how to respond to each Entity.

At the same time, we have the Mixins ([source](https://github.com/open-metadata/OpenMetadata/tree/main/ingestion/src/metadata/ingestion/ometa/mixins)) module, with special extensions to some Entities.

## Walkthrough

Let's use Python's API to create, update and delete a `Table` Entity. Choosing the `Table` is a nice starter, as its attributes define the following hierarchy:

```
DatabaseService -> Database -> Table
```

This will help us showcase how we can reuse the same syntax with the three different Entities.

### 1. Initialize OpenMetadata

`OpenMetadata` is the class holding the connection to the API and handling the requests. We can instantiate this by passing the proper configuration to reach the server API:

```python
from metadata.ingestion.ometa.ometa_api import OpenMetadata
from metadata.ingestion.ometa.openmetadata_rest import MetadataServerConfig

server_config = MetadataServerConfig(api_endpoint="http://localhost:8585/api")
metadata = OpenMetadata(server_config)
```

As this is just using a local development, the `MetadataServerConfig` is rather simple. However, in there we would prepare settings such as `auth_provider_type` or `secret_key`.

From this point onwards, we will interact with the API by using `OpenMetadata` methods.

An interesting validation we can already make at this point is verifying that the service is reachable and healthy. To do so, we can validate the `Bool` output from:

```python
metadata.health_check()  # `True` means we are alright :)
```

### 2. Create the DatabaseService

Following the hierarchy, we need to start by defining a `DatabaseService`. This will be system hosting our `Database`, which will contain the `Table`.

Recall how we have mainly two types of models:

* Entity definitions, such as `Table`, `MlModel` or `Topic`
* API definitions, useful when running a `PUT`, `POST` or `PATCH` request: `CreateTable`, `CreateMlModel` or `CreateTopic`.

As we are just creating Entities right now, we'll stick to the `pydantic` models with the API definitions.

Let's imagine that we are defining a MySQL:

```python
from metadata.generated.schema.api.services.createDatabaseService import (
    CreateDatabaseServiceEntityRequest,
)
from metadata.generated.schema.entity.services.databaseService import (
    DatabaseService,
    DatabaseServiceType,
)
from metadata.generated.schema.type.jdbcConnection import JdbcInfo

create_service = CreateDatabaseServiceEntityRequest(
    name="test-service-table",
    serviceType=DatabaseServiceType.MySQL,
    jdbc=JdbcInfo(driverClass="jdbc", connectionUrl="jdbc://localhost"),
)
```

Note how we can use both `String` definitions for the attributes, as well as specific types when possible, such as `serviceType=DatabaseServiceType.MySQL`. The less information we need to hardcode, the better.

We can review the information that will be passed to the API by visiting the JSON definition of the class we just instantiated. As all these models are powered by `pydantic`, this conversion is transparent to us:

```python
create_service.json()
# '{"name": "test-service-table", "description": null, "serviceType": "MySQL", "jdbc": {"driverClass": "jdbc", "connectionUrl": "jdbc://localhost"}, "ingestionSchedule": null}'
```

Executing the actual creation is easy! As our `create_service` variable already holds the proper datatype, there is a single line to execute:

```python
service_entity = metadata.create_or_update(data=create_service)
```

Moreover, running a `create_or_update` will return us the Entity type, so we can explore its attributes easily:

```python
type(service_entity)
# <class 'metadata.generated.schema.entity.services.databaseService.DatabaseService'

service_entity.json()
# '{"id": "6cfdfed2-66af-44e9-aea8-8add3912270f", "name": "test-service-table", "displayName": null, "serviceType": "MySQL", "description": null, "version": 0.1, "updatedAt": "2021-12-05T16:00:07.621000+00:00", "updatedBy": "anonymous", "href": "http://localhost:8585/api/v1/services/databaseServices/6cfdfed2-66af-44e9-aea8-8add3912270f", "jdbc": {"driverClass": "jdbc", "connectionUrl": "jdbc://localhost"}, "ingestionSchedule": null, "changeDescription": null}'
```

### 3. Create the Database

We can now repeat the process to create a `Database` Entity. However, if we review the definition of the `CreateDatabaseEntityRequest` model...

```python
class CreateDatabaseEntityRequest(BaseModel):
    name: database.DatabaseName = Field(
        ..., description='Name that identifies this database instance uniquely.'
    )
    description: Optional[str] = Field(
        None,
        description='Description of the database instance. What it has and how to use it.',
    )
    owner: Optional[entityReference.EntityReference] = Field(
        None, description='Owner of this database'
    )
    service: entityReference.EntityReference = Field(
        ..., description='Link to the database service where this database is hosted in'
    )
```

Note how the only non-optional fields are `name` and `service`. The type of `service,` however, is `EntityReference`. This is expected, as in there we need to pass the information of an existing Entity. In our case, the `DatabaseService` we just created.

Repeating the exercise and reviewing the required fields to instantiate an `EntityReference` we notice how we need to pass an `id: uuid.UUID` and `type: str`. Here we need to specify the `id` and `type` of our `DatabaseService`.

#### Querying by name

The `id` we actually saw it by printing the `service_entity` JSON. However, let's imagine that it did not happen, and the only information we have from the `DatabaseService` is its name.

To retrieve the `id`, we should then ask to the `metadata` to find our Entity by its FQDN:

```python
service_query = metadata.get_by_name(entity=DatabaseService, fqdn="test-service-table")
```

We have just used the `get_by_name` method. This method is the same that we will use for any Entity. This is why as an argument, we need to provide the `entity` field. Again, instead of relying on error-prone handwritten parameters, we can just pass the `pydantic` model we expect to get back. In our case, a `DatabaseService`.

Let's now pass the `DatabaseService` id to instantiate the `EntityReference`. We do not even need to cast it to `str`, as the `EntityReference` class expects an `UUID` as well:

```python
from metadata.generated.schema.api.data.createDatabase import (
    CreateDatabaseEntityRequest,
)
from metadata.generated.schema.type.entityReference import EntityReference

create_db = CreateDatabaseEntityRequest(
    name="test-db",
    service=EntityReference(id=service_entity.id, type="databaseService"),
)

db_entity = metadata.create_or_update(create_db)
```

### 4. Create the Table

Now that we have all the preparations ready, we can just reuse the same steps to create the `Table`:

```python
from metadata.generated.schema.api.data.createTable import CreateTableEntityRequest
from metadata.generated.schema.entity.data.table import (
    Column,
    DataType,
    Table,
)

create_table = CreateTableEntityRequest(
    name="test",
    database=db_entity.id,
    columns=[Column(name="id", dataType=DataType.BIGINT)],
)

table_entity = metadata.create_or_update(create_table)
```

### 5. Update the Table

Let's now update the `Table` by adding an owner. This will require us to create a `User`, and then update the `Table` with it. Afterwards, we will validate that the information has been properly stored.

First, make sure that no owner has been set during the creation:

```python
print(table_entity.owner)
# None
```

Now, create a `User`:

```python
from metadata.generated.schema.api.teams.createUser import CreateUserEntityRequest

user = metadata.create_or_update(
    data=CreateUserEntityRequest(name="random-user", email="random@user.com"),
)
```

Update our instace of `create_table` to add the `owner` field (we need to use the `Create` class as we'll run a `PUT`), and update the Entity:

```python
create_table.owner = EntityReference(id=user.id, type="user")
updated_table_entity = metadata.create_or_update(create_table)

print(updated_table_entity.owner)
# EntityReference(id=Uuid(__root__=UUID('48793f0c-5308-45c1-9bf4-06a82c8d7bf9')), type='user', name='random-user', description=None, displayName=None, href=Href(__root__=AnyUrl('http://localhost:8585/api/v1/users/48793f0c-5308-45c1-9bf4-06a82c8d7bf9', scheme='http', host='localhost', host_type='int_domain', port='8585', path='/api/v1/users/48793f0c-5308-45c1-9bf4-06a82c8d7bf9')))
```

If we did not save the `updated_table_entity` variable and we should need to query it to review the `owner` field, we can run the `get_by_name` using the proper FQDN definition for `Table`s:

```python
my_table = metadata.get_by_name(entity=Table, fqdn="test-service-table.test_db.test")
```

### 6. Delete the Table

Finally, we can clean up by running the `delete` method:

```python
metadata.delete(entity=Table, entity_id=str(my_table.id.__root__))
```
