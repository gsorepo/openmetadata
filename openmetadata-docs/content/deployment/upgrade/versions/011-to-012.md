# Upgrade from 0.11 to 0.12

Upgrading from 0.11 to 0.12 can be done directly on your instances. This page will list a couple of details that you
should take into consideration when running the upgrade.

## Highlights

### Data Profiler and Data Quality Tests

On 0.11, the Profiler Workflow handled two things:
- Computing metrics on the data
- Running the configured Data Quality Tests

There has been a major overhaul where not only the UI greatly improved, now showing all historical data, but on the
internals as well. Main topics to consider:

1. Tests now run with the Test Suite workflow and cannot be configured in the Profiler Workflow
2. Any past test data will be cleaned up during the upgrade to 0.12.0, as the internal data storage has been improved
3. The Profiler Ingestion Pipelines will be cleaned up during the upgrade to 0.12.0 as well.

### Profiler Workflow Updates

On top of the information above, the `fqnFilterPattern` has been converted into the same patterns we use for ingestion,
`databaseFilterPattern`, `schemaFilterPattern` and `tableFilterPattern`.

In the `processor` you can now configure:
- `profileSample` to specify the % of the table to run the profiling on
- `columnConfig.profileQuery` as a query to use to sample the data of the table
- `columnConfig.excludeColumns` and `columnConfig.includeColumns` to mark which columns to skip.
  - In `columnConfig.includeColumns` we can also specify a list of `metrics` to run from our supported metrics.

### Service Connection Updates

- DynamoDB
  - Removed: `database`
- Deltalake:
  - Removed: `connectionOptions` and `supportsProfiler`
- Looker
  - Renamed `username` to `clientId` and `password` to `clientSecret` to align on the internals required for the metadata extraction.
  - Removed: `env`
- Oracle
  - Removed: `databaseSchema` and `oracleServiceName` from the root.
  - Added: `oracleConnectionType` which will either contain `oracleServiceName` or `databaseSchema`. This will reduce confusion on setting up the connection.
- Athena
  - Removed: `hostPort`
- Databricks
  - Removed: `username` and `password`
