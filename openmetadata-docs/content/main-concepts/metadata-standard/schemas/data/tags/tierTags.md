# JSON Schema

*Tags related to tiering of the data. Tiers capture the business importance of data. When a data asset is tagged with `Tier` tag, all the upstream data assets used for producing it will also be labeled with the same tag. This will help upstream data asset owners to understand the critical purposes their data is being used.*
