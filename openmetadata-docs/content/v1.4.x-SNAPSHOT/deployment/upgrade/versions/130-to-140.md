# Upgrade from 1.3.x to 1.4.x

Upgrading from 1.3.x to 1.4.x can be done directly on your instances. This page will list few general details you should take into consideration when running the upgrade.


## Deprecation Notice

## Breaking Changes for 1.4.x Stable Release

### Dashboard & Pipeline Source Config Changes

We have restructured how we input the dbServiceNames field, used for creating lineage between pipeline(spline) and tables & dashboard data models and tables. This change was done in order to highlight the field on UI and improve user experience.

Please make note of changes in your yaml.

Before:
```
sourceConfig:
    config:
        type: DashboardMetadata # or PipelineMetadata
        .....
        dbServiceNames:
        - redshift_prod
        .....
```

After 1.4.0 Upgrade:
```
sourceConfig:
    config:
        type: DashboardMetadata # or PipelineMetadata
        .....
        lineageInformation:
            dbServiceNames:
            - redshift_prod
        .....
```

### Custom severity classifier config

We have updated `openmetadata.yaml` config file and removed the below setting option. If you were previously using it reach out to our team on #support channel in slack.

```
dataQualityConfiguration:
   severityIncidentClassifier: ${DATA_QUALITY_SEVERITY_INCIDENT_CLASSIFIER:-"org.openmetadata.service.util.incidentSeverityClassifier.LogisticRegressionIncidentSeverityClassifier"}
```
