# Metabase

In this section, we provide guides and references to use the Metabase connector.

## Requirements

To run the Ingestion via the UI you'll need to use the OpenMetadata Ingestion Container, which comes shipped with custom Airflow plugins to handle the workflow deployment.

You can find further information on the Metabase connector in the [docs](https://docs.open-metadata.org/connectors/dashboard/metabase).

### Host Port $(id="hostPort")

The hostPort parameter specifies the host and port of the Metabase instance. This should be specified as a string in the format `http://hostname:port` or `https://hostname:port`. 

For example, you might set the hostPort parameter to `https://org.metabase.com:3000`.
