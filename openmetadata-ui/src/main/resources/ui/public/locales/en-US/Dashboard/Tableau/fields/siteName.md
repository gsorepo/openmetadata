This corresponds to the `contentUrl` attribute in the Tableau REST API. 

The `site_name` is the portion of the URL that follows the `/site/` in the URL. 

For example, _MarketingTeam_ is the `site_name` in the following URL `MyServer/#/site/MarketingTeam/projects`. 

If it is empty, the default Tableau site will be used.
