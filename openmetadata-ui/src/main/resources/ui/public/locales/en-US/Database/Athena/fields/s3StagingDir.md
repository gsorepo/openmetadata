Amazon Athena automatically stores query results and metadata information for each query that runs in a query result 
location that you can specify in Amazon S3.

To set up an Amazon S3 query result location for the first time, see [Specifying a query result location using the Athena console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/querying.html#query-results-specify-location-console).

Find more information about [Working with query results, recent queries, and output files](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/querying.html).
