To connect programmatically to an AWS service, you use an endpoint. An *endpoint* is the URL of the 
entry point for an AWS web service. The AWS SDKs and the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) automatically use the 
default endpoint for each service in an AWS Region. But you can specify an alternate endpoint for your API requests.
