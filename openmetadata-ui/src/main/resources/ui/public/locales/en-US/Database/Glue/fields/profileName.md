A named profile is a collection of settings and credentials that you can apply to a AWS CLI command. 
When you specify a profile to run a command, the settings and credentials are used to run that command. 
Multiple named profiles can be stored in the config and credentials files.

You can inform this field if you'd like to use a profile other than `default`.
