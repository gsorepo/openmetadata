# Requirements
Connecting to Kafka does not require any previous configuration.

Just to remind you, the ingestion of the Kafka topics schema is done separately by configuring the **Schema Registry URL**. However, only the **Bootstrap Servers** information is mandatory.

You can find further information on the Kafka connector in the [docs](https://docs.open-metadata.org/connectors/messaging/kafka).
