# Requirements
Connecting to Redpanda does not require any previous configuration.

Just to remind you, the ingestion of the Redpanda topics schema is done separately by configuring the **Schema Registry URL**. However, only the **Bootstrap Servers** information is mandatory.

You can find further information on the Redpanda connector in the [docs](https://docs.open-metadata.org/connectors/messaging/redpanda).
