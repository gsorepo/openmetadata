# Requirements
For Connecting to Amundsen, need to make sure to pass `hostPort` with prefix such as:
    1. `bolt`(`Recommended`)
    2. `neo4j`
    3. `neo4j+ssc`


You can find further information on the Amundsen connector in the [docs](https://docs.open-metadata.org/connectors/metadata/amundsen).
