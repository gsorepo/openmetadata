Tooling:
-   Metadata Backup/Recovery is deprecated. No further support will be provided.
-   Users are advised to use database native tools to backup and store it in their object store for recovery.
-   bootstrap/bootstrap_storage.sh has been deprecated in favor of bootstrap/openmetadata-ops.sh

UI:
-   Activity has been improved. New update specific cards display critical information such as data quality test case updates, description, tag update or removal.
-   For Lineage, the Expand All button has been removed. A new Layers button is introduced at the bottom left corner. With the Layers button, you can add Column Level Lineage or Data Observability details to your Lineage view.
-   View Definition is now renamed as Schema Definition.
-   Adding Glossary Term view is improved. Now we show glossary terms hierarchically enabling a better understanding of how the terms are setup while adding it to a table or dashboard.
-  For Classification, users can set classification to be mutually exclusive only **at the time of creation**. Once created, you cannot change it back to mutually non-exclusive or vice-versa. This is to prevent conflicts of adding multiple tags that belong to same classification and later turning the mutually exclusive flag back to true.

API:
-   Table Schema's ViewDefinition is now renamed to SchemaDefinition to capture Tables' Create Schema.
-   Bulk Import API now creates entities if they are not present during the import.
-   Table's TestSuite is migrated to EntityReference. Previously it used to store entire payload of TestSuite.
